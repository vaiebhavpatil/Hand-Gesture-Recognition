Hand gesture recognition using computer vision and
convolutional neural networks has shown to be a powerful tool for human-
computer interaction. Through this project, we have demonstrated the
effectiveness of using convolutional neural networks for hand gesture
recognition, achieving high accuracy rates in recognizing different gestures.
The technology has numerous practical applications, including sign language
interpretation, virtual reality, and robotics. The ability to recognize hand
gestures accurately and in real-time can improve human-computer interaction,
making it more intuitive and natural.
Our project also highlights the importance of proper data preparation and model
optimization to achieve high accuracy rates in gesture recognition. We utilized
various techniques, including data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, to
optimize the performance of the model.
As with any technology, there is always room for improvement, and future work
could focus on further enhancing the accuracy and speed of the model.
Additionally, expanding the dataset to include more diverse hand shapes and
sizes can improve the model's robustness
